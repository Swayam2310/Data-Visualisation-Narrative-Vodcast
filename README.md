# Data-Visualisation-Narrative-Vodcast

This repository contains the resources for a narrative data visualisation project developed as part of a storytelling and analytics task. The project demonstrates how compelling insights can be communicated through effective visual storytelling using real-world data.

##  Project Overview

The aim of this project is to select and interpret one or more compelling data visualisations sourced from public datasets, and construct a 3-minute narrative vodcast around them. The goal is to highlight a key insight or message that resonates with the audience through clear and concise storytelling.

##  Narrative & Visuals

- The selected data visualisation(s) are used to explore patterns and insights within a real-world dataset.
- A self-constructed narrative guides the viewer through the visuals, emphasizing storytelling techniques over pure statistical explanation.
- The visuals and storyline are completely original and do not reuse existing narratives found online.

##  Repository Contents

- `Dashboard.Rmd` — The RMarkdown source file used to compile the visuals and build the narrative script.
- `README.md` — This project overview file.

##  Vodcast Output

The final output is a short vodcast (not included in this repo) that presents the narrative using the visuals created. The vodcast was designed to be accessible, engaging, and informative, targeting both general and data-literate audiences.

##  Tools Used

- **RMarkdown** for scripting the visuals and narrative.
- **ggplot2** and supporting R libraries for visualisation.
- Optional tools like screen recording software and audio editors were used to compile the vodcast.

##  Key Focus

- Effective data storytelling
- Clean, interpretable visualisations
- Audience engagement through structured narration
